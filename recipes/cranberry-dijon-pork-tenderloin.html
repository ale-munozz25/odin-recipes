</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>

    <li>Prep</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 450 degrees. Wash and dry produce.</li>
            <li>Dice potatoes into ½-inch pieces. Zest and quarter lemon. Peel and mince or grate ginger until you have 1 tsp. Pick rosemary leaves from stems; mince leaves until you have 1 tsp. </li>
        </ul>

    <li>Make Mashed Potatoes</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Place potatoes in a medium pot with enough salted water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, 15-20 minutes. </li>
            <li>Reserve ½ cup potato cooking liquid, then drain and return potatoes to pot. Mash with sour cream and 1 TBSP butter until smooth and creamy, adding splashes of reserved potato cooking liquid as needed. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.</li>
        </ul>

    <li>Sear Pork</li>

        <ul>
            <li>While potatoes cook, pat pork dry with paper towels and season all over with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add pork and sear, turning occasionally, until browned all over, 4-8 minutes (it'll finish cooking in the next step). </li>
            <li>Turn off heat; transfer pork to one side of a baking sheet. Wipe out pan</li>
        </ul>

    <li>Roast Pork & Beans</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Trim green beans if necessary. Toss green beans in a large bowl with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. Spread out on opposite side of sheet from pork. </li>
            <li>Roast on middle rack until pork is cooked through and green beans are tender, 10-12 minutes. </li>
            <li>Transfer pork to a cutting board to rest. Carefully toss green beans with lemon zest.</li>
        </ul>

    <li>Make Sauce</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Heat a drizzle of oil in pan used for pork over medium-high heat. Add minced ginger and minced rosemary; cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. </li>
            <li>Stir in jam, stock concentrate, mustard, and ¼ cup water. Simmer until slightly thickened, 2-3 minutes. </li>
            <li>Remove from heat; stir in 1 TBSP butter until melted.</li>
        </ul>

    <li>Finish & Serve</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Slice pork crosswise.</li>
            <li>Divide pork, mashed potatoes, and green beans between plates. Drizzle pork with sauce. Serve with lemon wedges on the side</li>
        </ul>

</ol>
