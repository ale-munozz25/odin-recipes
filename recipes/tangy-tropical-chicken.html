        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Prep</li>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Wash and dry all produce.</li>
                    <li>Halve, peel, and thinly slice half the shallot; finely chop remaining shallot. Peel and mince or grate ginger. Halve, core, and very thinly slice bell pepper into strips. Zest and quarter lime. Roughly chop cilantro.</li>
                </ul>

            <li>Cook Rice</li>

                <ul>
                    <li> Heat a drizzle of oil in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add chopped shallot and half the ginger; cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 minute.</li>
                    <li>Stir in rice, ¾ cup water, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.</li>
                </ul>

            <li>Cook Chicken</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>While rice cooks, pat chicken dry with paper towels and season all over with salt and pepper. </li>
                    <li>Heat a large drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until browned and cooked through, 3-5 minutes per side.</li>    
                    <li>Turn off heat. Transfer to a cutting board. Cover loosely with foil to keep warm.</li>
                </ul>

            <li>Cook Veggies</li>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Heat a drizzle of oil in pan used for chicken over medium-high heat. Add bell pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly tender, 4-5 minutes. </li>
                    <li>Add sliced shallot and remaining ginger; cook until softened, 2-3 minutes.</li>
                </ul>

            <li>Make Sauce</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Add pineapple and its juice, chili sauce, and juice from half the lime to pan with veggies. Bring to a simmer and cook until sauce is slightly thickened, 2-3 minutes. TIP: If sauce is too thick, stir in a splash of water.</li>
                    <li>Turn off heat; stir in half the cilantro and 1 TBSP butter. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
                </ul>

            <li>Finish & Serve</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Thinly slice chicken crosswise.</li>
                    <li>Fluff rice with a fork; stir in lime zest and 1 TBSP butter. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
                    <li>Divide rice between bowls; top with sliced chicken and saucy veggies. Sprinkle with remaining cilantro. Serve with remaining lime wedges on the side.</li>
                </ul>
