    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Prep</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry all produce. </li>
                <li>Cut tomato into ½-inch-thick wedges. Peel and finely chop garlic. Zest and quarter lemon. </li>
            </ul>

        <li>Cook Pasta & Peas</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Once water is boiling, add rigatoni to pot. Cook until al dente, 9-11 minutes.</li>
                <li>In the last 2 minutes of cooking, reserve ¾ cup pasta cooking water, then add peas to same pot and cook until tender. Drain.</li>
            </ul>

        <li>Cook Sausage</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Meanwhile, heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add sausage and cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned, 3-5 minutes (it'll cook through later). Season with salt and a pinch of chili flakes.</li>
            </ul>

        <li>Start Sauce</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Add tomato and garlic to pan with sausage. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tomato is slightly softened, 1-2 minutes. </li>
                <li>Cut top off carton of cream sauce base to open fully; pour contents into pan. Using a spoon or spatula, scrape any remaining sauce from carton into pan.</li>
            </ul>

        <li>Finish Sauce</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Pour in ¼ cup water. Bring to a simmer and cook until sauce is slightly thickened and sausage is cooked through, 2-3 minutes. Reduce heat to low. </li>
                <li>Stir in half the Parmesan (save the rest for serving) and 1 TBSP butter until melted. </li>
                <li>Add lemon juice and lemon zest to taste. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            </ul>

        <li>Finish & Serve</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Add drained rigatoni and peas to pan with sauce; toss to coat. If needed, stir in reserved pasta cooking water a splash at a time until everything is coated in a creamy sauce.</li>
                <li>Divide pasta between bowls and top with remaining Parmesan and a pinch of chili flakes if desired. Serve with any remaining lemon wedges on the side.</li>
            </ul>

    </ol>
